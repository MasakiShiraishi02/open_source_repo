# open_source_repo
Welcome to my repository! This project focuses on solving complex mathematical optimization and physics simulation problems using D-Wave machines, IBM Q, and deep reinforcement learning. My goal is to demonstrate practical implementations and use cases of these cutting-edge technologies to address real-world challenges.
## Key Features
- Quantum Annealing Applications
  - Demonstrates how to leverage D-Wave's quantum processing units (QPUs) for combinatorial optimization problems. 
- Gate-Based Quantum Computing
  - Explores optimization techniques using IBM Q's superconducting qubits and quantum circuits.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
  - Utilizes AI techniques to enhance optimization and decision-making processes. 
## Why Quantum Computing and AI?
Quantum computing platforms such as D-Wave and IBM Q offer unique capabilities to solve optimization and simulation problems beyond classical approaches. Deep reinforcement learning complements these methods by improving solution efficiency and adaptability.
